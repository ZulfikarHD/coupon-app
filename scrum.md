## **Implementation Changes & Technical Notes**

### Technology Stack Decisions
1. **Frontend Framework:** Inertia.js + Vue 3 + TypeScript (instead of Blade templates)
   - Modern SPA-like experience with server-side routing
   - Type-safe components with TypeScript
   - Uses shadcn/ui component library for consistent UI

2. **Coupon Code Generation:** Job-based approach instead of helper function
   - Created `App\Jobs\GenerateCouponCode` Job
   - Uses `dispatchSync()` for immediate execution in current process
   - Encapsulates all coupon creation logic in one place
   - Format: ABC-1234-XYZ (3 letters, 4 digits, 3 letters)

3. **API Structure:** 
   - API routes moved to `routes/api.php` with `auth:sanctum` middleware
   - Validation endpoint remains in `routes/web.php` for CSRF protection
   - API endpoints support both coupon code and full URL inputs

4. **Authentication:** 
   - Uses Laravel Sanctum for API authentication
   - Session-based auth for web routes
   - Password verification required for coupon validation (security measure)

### User Story 3.7: Performance Optimization
**As a** developer  
**I want** fast page loads  
**So that** staff can work efficiently

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Add database indexes:
  - coupons.code (unique index)
  - coupons.status (index)
  - coupons.customer_phone (index)
  - coupons.created_at (index)
  - coupons.expires_at (index)
  - coupon_validations.coupon_id (foreign key)
  - coupon_validations.validated_by (index)
- [ ] Optimize queries:
  - Use select() to limit columns
  - Eager load relationships (created_by, validations)
  - Add pagination everywhere (20-50 per page)
- [ ] Add query caching:
  - Dashboard stats (cache 5 minutes)
  - Reports stats (cache 10 minutes)
- [ ] Test with large dataset:
  - Seed 10,000 coupons
  - Measure load times
  - Optimize slow queries
- [ ] Enable Laravel debugbar in dev
- [ ] Check for N+1 queries

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- All pages load < 2 seconds

├── description
├── customer_name
├── customer_phone (indexed)
├── customer_email (nullable)
├── customer_social_media (nullable)
├── expires_at (nullable, indexed)
├── status (enum, indexed)
├── created_by (foreign → users)
└── timestamps

coupon_validations

## **Key Simplifications**

**What we removed:**
- ❌ Separate customers table

- ❌ Customer detail pages
- ❌ Customer loyalty tracking tables

**What we kept:**
- ✅ Customer info embedded in each coupon

**Benefits:**
- Simpler database structure
- Fewer relationships to manage
- Faster development time
- Less code to maintain
- Still tracks customer behavior via phone grouping
